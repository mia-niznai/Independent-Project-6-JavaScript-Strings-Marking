1. The first task asks you to store a new string in a variable to go along wth the existing one, which contains the missing half of the famous quote. Call the new variable you add quoteEnd.

You'll also need to escape the apostrophe in the existing string so that it doesn't throw an error.

Finally, you'll need to concatenate the two strings together, and store the result in a variable called finalQuote.

2. Next up, task 2 requires the student to:

    Check the length of the provided string using .length, and store the result in a variable called quoteLength.
    Find the index of the substring 'green eggs and ham' using .indexOf and store it in index.
    Use a combination of the variables you have, .length, and .slice(), to trim down the original quote to 'I do not like green eggs and ham.', and store it in revisedQuote.

3. 
For our next string task, we return to our Green Eggs and Ham revised quote, which someone has messed up. You need to:

    Fix the casing. The best way to do this is to put it all in lower case using .toLowerCase(), and then put the first letter in uppercase using replace(), slice(), and toUpperCase(). Store the new quote in fixedQuote.
    Replace green eggs and ham with whatever food you really don't like using replace().
    Add a full stop to the end of the sentence using some means.

4. Our final string task looks at your ability to use template literals. Your answer is expected to take the existing string literal, myString, turn it into a template literal, and include four placeholders in place of the asterisks:

    The theorem string.
    The value of a.
    The value of b.
    The length of the hypotenuse, if a and b are the lengths of the two shortest sides of a right-angled triangle. You can use pythagoras' theorem to work this out.
